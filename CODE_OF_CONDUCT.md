# Code of Conduct

We are committed to creating a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors to Intl-Currency-Calc. To help make sure that everyone feels comfortable and respected, we have adopted the following code of conduct.

## Our Pledge

-   We will be welcoming to all contributors regardless of their background, experience, or identity.
-   We will provide a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.
-   We will be respectful and courteous to all contributors, even if we disagree with them.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

-   Using welcoming and inclusive language
-   Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
-   Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
-   Focusing on what is best for the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

-   The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
-   Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
-   Public or private harassment
-   Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
-   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

The maintainers of the Intl-Currency-Calc project are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

## Scope

This code of conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project maintainers. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
